# CoAuthorshipNetwork

This project uses co-authorship data to create a network to investigate how academics collaborate. Our primary focus was maintaining privacy
while gathering information and building a network graph of between 400 and 500 distinct researchers. We mapped this network visually using
graph analysis software like NetworkX and Gephi,and we computed key metrics including PageRank, Clustering Coefficient, and Degree Distribu-
tion. These metrics enabled us to pinpoint important researchers and determine the primary collaboration patterns. This paper outlines the actions
we performed, the issues we encountered and resolved, and the lessons we discovered in scholarly collaboration
