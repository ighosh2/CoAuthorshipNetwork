# CoAuthorshipNetwork

This project uses co-authorship data to create a network to investigate how academics collaborate. Our primary focus was maintaining privacy
while gathering information and building a network graph of between 400 and 500 distinct researchers. We mapped this network visually using
graph analysis software like NetworkX and Gephi,and we computed key metrics including PageRank, Clustering Coefficient, and Degree Distribu-
tion. These metrics enabled us to pinpoint important researchers and determine the primary collaboration patterns. This paper outlines the actions
we performed, the issues we encountered and resolved, and the lessons we discovered in scholarly collaboration



This project delves into the complex realm of academic collaborations by developing a co-authorship network, underscoring the interconnectedness of researchers across various fields to foster knowledge
progression. In today’s digital academic landscape,analyzing these networks is crucial for unveiling the collaborative frameworks essential for innovation. Utilizing co-authorship data, this studymeticulously constructs a network graph to analyze academic collaboration patterns with sophisticated graph analysis tools. This introduction outlines the project’s methodology, analytical approaches, and
the significance of our discoveries for social network analysis. Focusing on Machine Learning within Computer Science, we examine co-authorship relations in scholarly publications. The project is
structured into four key segments: Data Collection, Data Visualization, Network Measure Analysis, and Results Discussion, utilizing the openaccess ”arXiv” repository and free distribution for
data collection, using NetworkX and Gephi for visualization. Metrics such as Degree Distribution, Clustering Coefficient, and PageRank are used to highlight important nodes and reveal the network’s
inherent structures
